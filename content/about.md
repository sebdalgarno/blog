Hi :wave: I'm Seb Dalgarno. 

This is my blog for all things R, fish movement, statistics, data visualization, and various other data/computery things. 

The blog name 'Fishy Data' is of course a little play on words. I work with fish data and this data is often [fishy](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fishy). The data cleaning process has forced me to become a better coder and to think more deeply about efficient analysis pipelines.

I'm a PhD student at the UNBC [Freshwater Fish Ecology lab](https://www.ffishlab.ca/). We are using many years of acoustic telemetry data and Bayesian models to make inferences about White Sturgeon movement in the Columbia River. Formerly, I was a computational biologist at [Poisson Consulting](https://www.poissonconsulting.ca). 

Check out my [academic](htpps://www.sebdalgarno.netlify.app) and [consulting](https://www.northbeachconsulting.ca/) websites for more info. Also check out some recordings from my band [Rusty Mould and the Sugar Agates](https://rustymouldandthesugaragates.bandcamp.com/)!

Thanks for stopping by.
