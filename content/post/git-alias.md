title: Using a git alias to commit and stage all files
weight: 10

**TL;DR** type `git config --global alias.coa "!git add -A && git commit -m"` in the command line. From now on, use `git coa 'message here'` to commit and stage all files!

# Overview
For years I have staged, committed and pushed changes with the RStudio Git interface.

It works! But I've realized that it's much more efficient (and not hard!) to do from the command line. Check out [this sweet resource by Jenny Bryan](https://happygitwithr.com/) for more info on git with r.

# Git from the command line
I found [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2419249/how-can-i-stage-and-commit-all-files-including-newly-added-files-using-a-singl) on stackoverflow, which suggests staging and committing all files by running the following in the command line:

```
git add -A && git commit -m "rebuild site"
```
We can push like this:
```
git push
```

# Git alias
The real productivity gains are made by using a [git alias](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases), which saves having to type (and remember) full git commands. Let's start with a simple example. To set up the alias `git p` for `git push`, we type in the command line:
```
git config --global alias.p "push"
```
And to set up the alias `git c` for `git commit`:
```
git config --global alias.c "commit"
```

Going back to our previous case of stage/commit all, we can set up the alias `git coa`:
```
git config --global alias.coa "!git add -A && git commit -m"
```

From now on, we can stage, commit and push all changes with two simple commands:
```
git coa 'rebuild site'
```
```
git p
```
# Keyboard shortcut to Terminal
To completely remove the need to use the mouse, I've set up a customized keyboard shortcut[^1] <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>3</kbd> to move the cursor to the RStudio Terminal. Check out [this great tutorial](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206382178-Customizing-Keyboard-Shortcuts) on customizing keyboard shortcuts in RStudio. The advantage of using the RStudio terminal and not the MacOS Terminal app (or iterm2)[^3] is that it is automatically drilled down into the directory of your project.

[^1]: I also use <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>1</kbd> to move cursor to script and <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>2</kbd> to move cursor to console.
[^3]: These tips are for Mac users. I'm not sure how to do the above in Windows.
