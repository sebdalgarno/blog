# The problem
I find myself navigating around the GitHub site between various repos/issues etc. This requires too much mouse use and [context switching](https://www.cognoshr.com/knowledge/2018/7/10/context-switching-the-ever-present-productivity-killer-and-what-you-can-do-to-keep-it-at-bay#:~:text=Context%20switching%20states%20that%20every,nearly%20half%20of%20your%20time.) when many of these tasks could be done from the command line. 

# The solution
[GitHub command line interface (cli)](https://cli.github.com/) `gh`. You can see the full list of commands [here](https://cli.github.com/manual/) and some resources for setting up scripts and aliases [here](https://cli.github.com/manual/#extending-the-cli) but I'll go over a few things that I've started to use recently.
