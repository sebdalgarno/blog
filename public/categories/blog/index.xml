      <description>Selecting a theme I made this blog with blogdown. blogdown is an R package by the awesome Yihui Xie that allows you to combine Hugo and Rmarkdown. For example, if you check out Joe Thorley&amp;rsquo;s sweet blog and this post, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it is great for demonstrating R code and generating output from that code to explain analyses and statistical concepts. Even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t using R though, it is just really sweet to make posts in plain markdown.</description>
