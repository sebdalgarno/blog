      <description>Selecting a theme I made this blog with blogdown. blogdown is an R package by the awesome Yihui Xie that allows you to combine Hugo and Rmarkdown. For example, if you check out Joe Thorley&amp;rsquo;s sweet blog and this post, you can see that it is great for demonstrating R code and generating output from that code to explain analyses and statistical concepts. Even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t using R though, it is just really sweet to make posts in plain markdown.</description>

      <description>This is a series of posts that will aim to:
1. outline a philosophy and structure for the ideal acoustic telemetry database
1. justify this philosophy and structure within the context of a broader analysis pipeline (i.e. inputs/outputs) 1. demonstrate specific SQL and R code to achieve this
This first post will focus on the first two points.
The analysis pipeline: punch raw data -&amp;gt; clean data for db -&amp;gt; insert data into db (via app) -&amp;gt; receive informative error messages -&amp;gt; repeat until successful -&amp;gt; PostgreSQL functions tidy data -&amp;gt; read tidied data into R for analysis</description>
