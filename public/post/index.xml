      <description>Selecting a theme I made this blog with blogdown. blogdown is an R package by the awesome Yihui Xie that allows you to combine Hugo and Rmarkdown. For example, if you check out Joe Thorley&amp;rsquo;s sweet blog and this post, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it is great for demonstrating R code and generating output from that code to explain analyses and statistical concepts. Even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t using R though, it is just really sweet to make posts in plain markdown.</description>

      <description>The problem If you are opening and closing a lot of RStudio projects throughout the day, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to think about the most efficient way to search for and open .Rproj files. I want to avoid using my mouse in a Finder window and I find that the default Mac search app Spotlight provides too many results.
The solution I came across this tip by Hadley Wickham that makes use of the Alfred app1.</description>

      <description>The problem For years I have staged, committed and pushed changes with the RStudio Git interface.
It works! But it can be time-consuming when you are doing it a lot. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to use my mouse less. It would be better to do this in the comand line.
The solution I found this solution on stackoverflow, which suggests staging and committing all files by running the following in the command line:</description>
